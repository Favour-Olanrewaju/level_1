    "1. Explanation of Model Deployment with Flask\n",
    "Model deployment refers to the process of taking a trained machine learning model and making it available for use by other applications or users. One common way to deploy a machine learning model is by exposing it as a web service, where users can send data (e.g., images, text, or numbers) and get predictions in return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a popular Python web framework that can be used for creating such web services. Using Flask, we can wrap our model inside an API (application programming interface) and deploy it on a web server. This allows users to interact with the model by sending HTTP requests (such as POST requests) and receiving the modelâ€™s predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps Involved in Deployment:\n",
    "Train the Model: We first need a trained model (this can be a classification, regression, or any other type of model).\n",
    "Create a Flask API: Using Flask, we create an API endpoint that receives input data, runs the data through the model, and returns the predictions.\n",
    "Run the Flask App: We run the Flask application locally or deploy it on a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud).\n",
    "2. Importance of Model Deployment\n",
    "Model deployment is crucial because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-Time Predictions: It allows us to make predictions on new data in real time, as users can interact with the model through an API.\n",
    "Scalability: Once the model is deployed, multiple users can interact with it concurrently, making it scalable.\n",
    "Accessibility: Deployment makes machine learning models accessible for integration with other applications, such as web apps or mobile apps.\n",
